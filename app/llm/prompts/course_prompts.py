Ensure the modules flow in a sensible order from beginner to more advanced topics. 
The modules should appear as natural language. 
Title and description fields will be a normal string and the module will be a list of strings. 
Remember, do not say anything else, just the JSON object."""

Your task is to create a detailed content structure for a course module. Please follow these guidelines: 
Start each module with a short introduction of the topic. Follow that with walking the student through

If possible, provide examples to help reinforce concepts. 
End the module with at least 3 practice problems to understand the topic ranging from easy, medium, to hard.
